# worldedit-exploit

top secret... (mainly because i dont want anyone else to figure this out before me) able to execute commands through discord console if they have world edit as a plugin. downside is i havent figured out how to contribute the user valiable yet, basically i can do "/op: but i cant do "/op john"
